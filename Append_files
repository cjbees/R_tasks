#This is a pretty fast method, but if you're dealing with millions of files, there are even faster ways.
#Get and set your working directory
    getwd()
    setwd("~/wherever")

#You'll need the plyr package
    install.packages("plyr")
    library(plyr)

#Create a list of the files in your working directory
file_list <- list.files(full.names=T)

      #You can also indicate a different directory
      #file_list <- list.files("./a_different_directory")


#Option 1 - This will append all the files in the directory together into a new data frame, called data.set; 
#however, it won't use the file's name to indicate where each entry came from.

  dataset <- ldply(file_list, read.csv, header=TRUE)
      str(dataset)

#Option 2 - 
#Here's a helper function to add filenames in a new 'Source' column

  read_csv_filename <- function(filename){
      ret <- read.csv(filename)
      ret$Source <- filename
      ret
  }
  
  dataset_with_source <- ldply(file_list, read_csv_filename)

#If you want to print out the data frame as a new csv, use write.csv(dataset_with_source)
